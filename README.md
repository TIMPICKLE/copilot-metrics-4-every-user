# Introduction

## Why Built This
Because according to the official Copilot document [REST API endpoints for Copilot metrics - GitHub Enterprise Cloud Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-metrics?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-copilot-metrics-for-a-team): 

> This endpoint will only return results for a given day if the team had five or more members with active Copilot licenses on that day, as evaluated at the end of that day.

So, if you want to view the usage of Copilot, the smallest granularity is Teams, and it is a Team with at least 5 members. if this is OK for you, just follow [Copilot Usage Advanced Dashboard](https://github.com/satomic/copilot-usage-advanced-dashboard) to visualize it.

But, if you are an admin of your Enterprise/Organizations/Teams with GitHub Copilot enabled, and you want to know the usage details of every users, try this project. this is why built this.


## Key Features
- A proxy plugin to capture and log HTTP requests and responses between your IDE and GitHub Copilot APIs. 
- Save the usage details data of every user, and generate user-dimensional metrics.
- Whitelisting of Allowed users, supports basic authentication

# Warning
- these are general guidelines for copilot block:
  1. **Do not change any GitHub Copilot http headers on network**
  2. Do not share GitHub accounts and GitHub Copilot access
     - GitHub personal account can not be shared, GitHub can block those shared accounts.
     - GitHub Copilot access can not be shared between multiple users.
  3. Maintain a single GitHub Copilot access network outbound so one user do not access GitHub Copilot from different locations at the same time
  4. do not use a program to generate copilot token, the token need to be requested from official GitHub Copilot IDE extension
- GitHub does not recommend customer on solution that is not part of GitHub product, in the case of internet proxy officially GitHub support will not support issues on proxy or advise which proxy to use.



# Features

## Normal Features

- **Proxy traffic**. For a network-isolated development environment.
- **Prompts Recording**. Captures HTTP requests and responses and logs the details to files, **this will let you know exactly what the code snippets (prompts) uploaded by Copilot are**.

  ![](image/image_fbSoEERHlo.png)

## Advanced Features

- **Usage Insight of Every User**. Supports basic authentication, this allows you to get the data of the user dimension, more deeper than team dimension.

# How to Use

## Admin: Server Side

### Install Proxy `mitmproxy`

1. Prepare an intermediary server, with IP address `a.b.c.d` (The following diagrams and documents all use `127.0.0.1` as an example. Please replace it with your actual IP address).
2. Follow the doc to [install mitmproxy](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/overview-installation/ "install mitmproxy"). If you use pip to install mitmproxy on Windows, you need to add the exe path to the environment variable.

### Configure `proxy_addons.py`

1. There are some key parameters to configure in `proxy_addons.py`, mitmproxy will automatically reload the script once it has been modified.
   ```python
   # Conditional judgment, It is recommended to set it to True, which will perform rule checks on all requests to ensure that the number of chats and completions are not counted multiple times.
   conditional_judgment = True # False True

   # if you want to use advanced feature, set this to True. This requires that the user must configure basic authentication
   is_proxy_auth_needed = True # False True

   # This value is very sensitive, please change it to a value that only you know. This is the key parameter used to calculate the password.
   random_seed = 123456

   # Limit access to only these users
   # All users you allow to use Copilot through this proxy can be customized, and they do not need to be the same as the username used to log in to Copilot.
   # This plugin will automatically generate passwords and save them in logs/user_auth.json. As an administrator, please protect this file and tell each user their generated passwords.
   allowed_usernames = [
       "satomic",
       "xuefeng",
   ]
   ```
2. run command in console
   ```bash
   mitmdump --listen-host 0.0.0.0 --listen-port 8080 --set block_global=false -s proxy_addons.py
   ```
3. The contents of the automatically generated `logs/user_auth.json` are as follows
   ```json
   {
       "satomic": "961aa8753b",
       "xuefeng": "1b3ecfa5aa"
   }
   ```
4. Tell these users their usernames and passwords

## Users: Client Side

### Configure Proxy in IDEs & Install Certs

1. now you can set the proxy in your IDE (VSCode as example here, if you are using JetBrains, after set proxy, you need to restart the JetBrains IDE), and the IP address is `127.0.0.1` as an example, please change it to your actual IP address.
   - for **normal features**, set the proxy like: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, only if the Admin set `is_proxy_auth_needed = False` in Server side.
     ![](image/image_0XGhMWYhpy.png)
   - for **advanced features**, set the proxy like: `http://your_username:your_passowrd@127.0.0.1:8080` (the username is `satomic`  and pwd is `961aa8753b `as an sample).
     ![](image/image_G00s77UbR-.png)

     or in `settings.json`
     ```json
     "http.proxy": "http://satomic:961aa8753b@127.0.0.1:8080"
     ```
2. However, at this time, IDE will prompt certificate errors, so a [certificate needs to be installed](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-certificates/ "certificate needs to be installed"). The certificate download requires access to [mitm.it](mitm.it "mitm.it"), and the prerequisite for normal access is that mitmproxy is functioning normally. Therefore, before enabling the proxy, only requests that go through the proxy will return normal web pages.

### By Using Copilot to Check if Proxy Works

1. now you can use the Copilot to generate code, and the request and response will be saved in the `logs` folder.&#x20;
   - The `metrics` folder stores daily usage metrics statistics.&#x20;
   - The `usage` folder is a subdirectory with the user name, which records the detailed data of `chat` and `completions` respectively.

## Metrics log
Different event types are now visible in metrics, including `nes`, `agent`, `edits`, `chat-inline`, `chat-panel`, etc. Additionally, statistics are now tracked by model type, recording the number of times different AI models are used within each editor version.

Below is a detailed explanation of the metrics JSON file structure:

```json
{
    "day": "2025-03-11",                  // Current date
    "total_chat_turns": 162,              // Total chat turns from all users for the day
    "total_completions_count": 0,         // Total code completions from all users for the day
    "usage": {                            // Usage data grouped by users

```

This structure allows you to analyze data across multiple dimensions:
- Usage analysis by user
- Differentiation between chat functions and code completion features
- Grouping by action type (chat panel, inline chat, edits, etc.)
- Analysis by editor version
- Analysis by AI model type
- For code completion features, analysis by programming language

This multi-dimensional statistical data can help you gain deep insights into the Copilot usage patterns of each team member.
